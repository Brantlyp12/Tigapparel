        <p>Fear can be paralyzing, but faith empowers us to move forward. When we rely on God’s strength rather than our own, we realize that fear has no control over us. Faith reassures us that God is always by our side, guiding us through every storm.</p>
        <p>By focusing on prayer, scripture, and positive affirmations, we can replace fear with unwavering trust in God’s plan.</p>
